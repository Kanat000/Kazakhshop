                            <p>Kazakh Shop unites suppliers of the best products from the Republic of Kazakhstan.</p>
                            <p>Since 2012, we have been selling products that are loved so much by everyone who has tried them at least once. More than 35 manufacturers and 1800 product names.</p>
                            <p>We know how difficult it is now to find high-quality and tasty products manufactured in accordance with all the requirements of GOSTs and standards, therefore we have
                                created a network of stores where it became possible and affordable for everyone.</p>

                        <h5>Brand history</h5>
                        <p>Three classmates, Kanat, Zukhra and Danial, began to develop the company in 2020 after starting their studies at Astana IT University. A month later, the first store opened in the Mega Silk Way shopping and entertainment center.</p>
                        <p>A month after the opening of the store, wholesales began across the country. We grew because buyers highly appreciated the quality of the products, and the demand increased. Inquiries from other regions began to arrive: "We want our products from Kazakhstan to be available to everyone!"</p>
                        <p>All this proves one simple thing: it is important for people to understand that the food on their table is tasty, healthy and environmentally friendly. They choose us because they know that they are guaranteed the best quality of products, and this is how the quality of life increases.</p>
